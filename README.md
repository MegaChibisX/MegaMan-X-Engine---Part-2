# MegaMan-X-Engine---Part-2

 A MegaMan X project that I'm working on in parts for YouTube.

This tutorial will be using Unity 3D, and its aim is to make a MegaMan X game, or a reasonable engine that lets people make one themselves.

If you end up using it, let me know! It will be pretty cool to hear!
